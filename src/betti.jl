"""
Return the array betti such that betti[i+1] is the 2i-th (combinatorial) Betti number for i in {0,1,...,valency(gkm)}, as defined in [Guillemin--Zara, section 1.3].
Note:
 * i ranges from 0 to valency(gkm).
 * from [Guillemin--Zara, Theorem 1.3.2], the combinatorial Betti numbers equal the Betti numbers of the underlying
   GKM space if the torus action is Hamiltonian.
Warning:
 * betti[1] is the 0-th Betti number, since Julia arrays are 1-based and not 0-based.
