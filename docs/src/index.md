# GKMtest.jl


This Julia package is work in progress. It offers support for calculations involving GKM varieties, including their equivariant Gromov-Witten invariants. It requires Oscar. See https://www.oscar-system.org/install/.

It comes with the supporting article: (Work in Progress...)

It is divided in two parts. The first one deals with foundational material on GKM varieties in general. The second part is dedicated to the computation of equivariant Gromovâ€“Witten invariants, equivariant quantum cohomology and equivariant Seidel elements (shift operators).
