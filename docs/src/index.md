# GKMtest.jl


This package is work in progress. It gives support for computations involving GKM varities. It requires Oscar. See https://www.oscar-system.org/install/.

It cames with the supporting article: arxiv.org

It is divided in two parts. The first one deals with fundational material on GKM varieties in general. The second part is dedicated to the computation of Gromovâ€“Witten invariants and Equivariant Quantum Cohomology Ring.
